                You can vote in person on Election Day, you can vote early at

                to get started or check and see if you are registered. If you
                are registered already, it will also give you your polling place
                location and absentee ballot options.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you are registering in person, you must present two forms of
                ID, one of which must show your current address. Chicago voters
                may use any of the dozens of Early Voting locations in the city:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>At the Loop Super Site from Jan. 30 - Feb. 25; and</li>
                <li>At the 50 ward sites from Feb. 11 - Feb. 25.</li>

              <h3><strong>Can I register to vote on Election Day? </strong></h3>
              <p>
                Election Day registration is also available on Feb. 26th, but
                only at the polling place assigned to your home precinct. (Just
                to be safe, we recommend registering in advance!)

              <h3><strong>Can I vote early?</strong></h3>
              <p>
                Yes. There are two windows of in-person early voting starting
                Jan. 28, described below. Remember: A government-issued photo ID
                is not required but is helpful if there is a question about your
                registration, address or signature, or if there are two voters
                with the same or similar names at the same address.
              </p>
              <p>
                Registration services are available at every Early Voting site,
                and any voter who needs to register for the first time, or file
                an address update or a name change must show two forms of ID,
                one of which shows the voter's current address.
              </p>
              <p>That ballot you cast in Early Voting is final.</p>
              <p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                It depends. You must bring a government-issued photo ID if
                you've changed your address or are voting for the first time at
                your polling place
              </p>
              <p>
                You do NOT need a photo ID if you are voting on Election Day and
                have voted from your current address before.<br /><br />

              </h3>
              <p>
                No, but you may need to provide a government-issued photo ID as
                explained above.
              </p>
              <h3><strong>Can I vote by mail?</strong></h3>
              <p>
                Yes. Anyone can vote by mail. However, in order to receive a
                ballot, you will have to submit a Vote By Mail application.
                Applications can be submitted online or at the offices of the
                Board of Elections. The deadline for requesting a ballot is 5
                p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 21. You can find more information at the
                <a href="https://chicagoelections.com/en/vote-by-mail.html"

              <h3><strong>Can I vote online or via social media?</strong></h3>
              <p>No. Sorry.</p>
              <h3><strong>What's a runoff election?</strong></h3>
              <p>
                In order to win an elected position in the 2019 Municipal
                Elections, a candidate must receive a majority, or more than 50
                percent of the votes. If no candidate wins on February 26th in a
                race, the top two candidates in the race will compete in a
                runoff election on April 2, 2019.
              </p>

                That is, of course, entirely up to you. While the Chi.vote
                Collective does not endorse candidates for public office, we can

                There are a variety of mayoral forums and debates planned. Many
                require advanced registration or membership in a hosting club.
                However, several live mayoral candidate forums are available on
                television or online.
