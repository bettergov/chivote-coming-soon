            <h1>Voting FAQ: The What, Where, When &amp; How</h1>

            <p>
              On March 20th, Illinois voters will select their party’s nominees
              for the November 2018 general election.
            </p>

            <p>
              In some cases, the primary is the only real chance voters have to
              weigh in on the 2018 election because one party tends to dominate
              the political landscape. For 19 seats in the Illinois House of
              Representatives, three seats in the Illinois Senate, and many Cook
              County positions only one party is running candidates and the
              winner of the primary is likely to be the ultimate winner of the
              general election. Political parties do have a window to appoint
              candidates to run after the primary, but they might not always do
              so.
            </p>

            <p>Illinois voters will NOMINATE candidates for:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Illinois Governor</li>
              <li>Illinois Attorney General</li>
              <li>Representatives in Congress — All 18 Districts</li>
              <li>
                Representatives in the Illinois General Assembly — All 118
                Districts
              </li>
              <li>
                Senators in the Illinois General Assembly – 39 of 59 Districts
              </li>
              <li>
                Judicial Vacancies, Regional Superintendents, and Local Offices
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In addition, your local ballot might ask for your views on local
              school funding or other policy and tax-related matters.
            </p>

            <h3>Am I registered to vote?</h3>

            <p>
              You can check your registration status on the state’s
              <a href="https://ova.elections.il.gov/RegistrationLookup.aspx"
                >Registration Lookup website</a
              >. If you’re registered, the website also will provide your
              polling location.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I register to vote?</h3>

            <p>
              You will need two forms of acceptable ID, including at least one
              document with your current address and one with your photo.
            </p>

            <p>Acceptable forms of ID include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Driver’s license</li>
              <li>State identification card</li>
              <li>Passport</li>
              <li>
                Current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck
                stub, or other government document that shows your name and
                current address
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Before February 20th</strong>, you may register to vote at
              the following locations: county clerk offices, board of election
              commissioner offices, city and village offices, township offices,
              schools, public libraries, military recruitment centers.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>After February 20th</strong>, you may register in person
              only at the time you vote, at select locations in your county. You
              can find these locations on your county’s election website.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, until <strong>March 4th</strong>,
              <a href="https://ova.elections.il.gov/"
                >you may use this online application to register to vote</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can register to vote on Election Day,
              <strong>March 20th</strong>. However, you can only do so in your
              home precinct. The same ID requirements apply.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Do I have to be registered with a political party to vote in the
              primary?
            </h3>

            <p>
              No. Illinois has what is known as an open primary. You do not need
              to be registered with a political party. However, at the polling
              place you will need to tell a poll worker which party’s ballot you
              would like and you can only choose one.
            </p>

            <h3>Once registered, can I vote early?</h3>

            <p>
              Yes. Early voting in most of Illinois begins February 8th and ends
              March 19th.

            <div>
              <p>
                Due to delays in legal battles over whether some candidacies can
                continue, in Cook County suburbs, early voting is scheduled to
                begin March 5th.

            <h3>Can I vote by mail?</h3>

            <p>
              Voting by mail requires an application. In order to complete a
              ballot and mail it for the primary, you must complete the
              application by <strong>March 15th</strong>. For those who have
              completed their application and received a ballot, mailed ballots
              must be postmarked no later than Election Day (March 20th), and
              must be received within 14 days of the election.

              >.
            </p>

            <h3>Where is my polling place?</h3>

            <p>
              You can find the location of your polling place on the
              <a href="https://ova.elections.il.gov/RegistrationLookup.aspx"
                >Registration Lookup website</a
              >, or on your county’s website. If you’ve moved since the last
              election, make sure to re-register listing your new address. The
              rules that apply if you’ve moved and need to re-register can be
              found

              >.
            </p>

            <h3>Do I need an ID to vote?</h3>

            <p>
              It depends. You will need to present a government-issued ID if:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>You register between February 20th and March 20th</li>
              <li>
                You are a new voter who has registered by mail and have not
                previously supplied the election board with appropriate ID
              </li>
            </ul>
